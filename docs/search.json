For example, a positive correlation between GDP per Capita and Life Expectancy might suggest that countries with higher incomes tend to have longer life expectancies.\nThe correlation matrix shows a moderate positive relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy (r ≈ 0.64), indicating that higher income levels are generally associated with longer life expectancies. In contrast, both GDP per capita and life expectancy have almost no relationship with total population (r ≈ -0.06 and r ≈ -0.01, respectively), suggesting that a country’s population size does not significantly impact these measures."
